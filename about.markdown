I'm Wenjin Zeng. I have been intensively worked on DB Ops and Dev in the last 10+ years. I was lucky enough to involved in running one of the largest e-commercial site in the world. Weâ€™ve been supported 1 trillion calls per day with 99.994% availability for 5+ years. One year we reached 99.999% availability which means 5 minutes impact time in a year. We have only about 30 teammates to support 10000 database instances. The rate is about 300 DB per person. I would like to share some best practices that I think make this happen. I would happy to know if it can inspire/help you. Reach out to me at alezeng @ gmail.
