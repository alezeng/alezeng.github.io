I'm Wenjin Zeng. I will share my DB DevOps experiences. I'll not only share what but also why, the thoughts behind, which I think it's important. What I did may or may not be the optimized way but I will make sure what I said is what I did, and it worked. I would happy to know if it can inspire/help you.
